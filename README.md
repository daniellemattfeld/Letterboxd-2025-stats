# Letterboxd 2025 stats
I created my own end of the year Letterboxd stats using Pandas and Excel. Then used PowerBi to display the data, recreating the Letterboxd style. 

I wanted to have my yearly stats avalible to me, but I don't pay for a pro account with Letterboxd. Letterboxd only provides your diary, which has when you logged films, your rating, and if it was a rewatch. I also wanted the genre, languages, and country of orgin, and in order to get that information, I used TMDb and the tmdbsimple wrapper. I used the [TMDb documentation](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started), as well as this [repo by asmasyfqh](https://github.com/asmasyfqh/my-letterboxd-analysis).
